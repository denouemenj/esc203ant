# Sigma.js - sigmajs.org website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Please acknowledge that the homepage won't be available in development though, since it is a static HTML file that is outside the React / React-Router expected workflow.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
